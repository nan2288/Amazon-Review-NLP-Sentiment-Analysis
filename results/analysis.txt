=== ANALYSIS ===

The words most similar to "good" like 'excellent' and 'great' carry positive sentiment, while those similar to "bad" like 'terrible' and 'awful' are predominantly negative. 

This pattern occurs because Word2Vec learns word embeddings from contextual usage. When words consistently appear in similar emotional contexts, their vectors become aligned. 

These results demonstrate Word2Vec's ability to capture semantic meaning and sentiment polarity by analyzing co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora.



1. Are the words most similar to "good" generally positive in sentiment?
2. Are the words most similar to "bad" generally negative in sentiment?
3. Why do you think this is or isn't the case?
4. What does this tell you about how Word2Vec learns word representations?

[Your analysis should demonstrate understanding of:]
- How Word2Vec uses context to learn word meanings
- The difference between semantic similarity and sentiment
- Why Word2Vec might capture sentiment patterns in the data
